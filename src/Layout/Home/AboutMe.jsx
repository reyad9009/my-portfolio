          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            Hi, I'm G. M. Mortuja, a passionate web developer who is always excited to learn and grow. My journey into the world of programming began a few years ago when I first encountered the power of web development. I was fascinated by how code could transform ideas into interactive, functional websites, and that sparked my interest in becoming a developer.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            Initially, I started with HTML and CSS, experimenting with basic layouts and designs. As I got more comfortable, I delved into JavaScript, which opened a whole new world of dynamic content and interactivity. Over time, I embraced the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and it's become my go-to toolkit for building modern, full-stack web applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            What I enjoy most about programming is the problem-solving aspect. Whether it's debugging a tricky issue or optimizing a piece of code, I love the challenge that comes with making things work seamlessly. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and techniques that can help me build better, more efficient applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            Outside of programming, I'm an avid sports enthusiast. I enjoy playing football and basketball with my friends, as it helps me unwind and stay active. I also love reading books, especially on self-improvement and technology. Whenever I find some free time, I enjoy painting, which allows me to express my creativity in a different way. It's important to have a balance between work and hobbies, and these activities help me stay motivated and inspired.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology, creativity, and growth. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat about web development, tech trends, or anything else!
